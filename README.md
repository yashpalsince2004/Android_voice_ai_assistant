# 📱 Android Voice AI Assistant — Day 12

A step-by-step guide to building your own **Android Voice-Controlled AI Assistant**, written in Hinglish (Hindi + English) for better understanding.  
This project demonstrates how to create a simple yet powerful AI assistant that responds to wake words and performs actions like opening apps or speaking responses.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📣 **Wake word detection**: Start interacting with your assistant using a custom wake word.
- 🎙️ **Voice Commands**: Open apps like YouTube or Camera, or get the current time.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The assistant speaks back its responses.
- 🤖 Written with a blend of **Java**, **Android SDK**, and AI concepts.
- 📖 Code and explanations are provided in Hinglish for easier learning.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Android Studio
- Java
- Android SpeechRecognizer
- Android TextToSpeech
- Wake Word Logic (custom)
- Hinglish Documentation (educational)
